  "recommendation": "Alright, let's break down your batting technique! Overall, there's a lot of potential here. You've got some strong areas, and with a few tweaks, we can really elevate your game.\n\n\ud83c\udfcf **Overall Summary**\n\nYou show excellent balance and a great follow-through, which are fantastic foundations. Head position is also a strength. However, footwork and swing control need some attention. Don't worry, we'll work on those!\n\n\u2705 **What You Did Well**\n\n*   **Head Position (5/10):** You maintained good head alignment for a decent portion of the initial frames. \"Head aligned in 91/179 frames (first 3s).\" This helps with focus and seeing the ball clearly.\n*   **Balance (5/10):** Your balance was well maintained in the majority of the initial frames. \"Balanced in 98/179 frames (first 3s).\" A stable base is crucial for power and consistency.\n*   **Follow-through (10/10):** Excellent! \"Good follow-through in 30/30 end frames.\" This indicates you're committing to the shot and transferring your weight effectively.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Mistakes to Work On**\n\n*   **Footwork (3/10):** \"Footwork OK in 112/300 frames.\" This suggests inconsistency in getting into the right position. The frame-level data shows that the `foot_ok` check is consistently `False` in the initial frames, indicating a recurring issue early in the stance/movement.\n*   **Swing Control (2/10):** \"Elbow correct in 50/179 frames (first 3s).\" The frame data shows fluctuating elbow angles and elbow_ok checks, especially at the beginning and middle of the swing, which suggests inconsistency in your technique.\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Do\u2019s**\n\n*   Maintain a stable head position throughout your stance and swing.\n*   Focus on keeping your balance, especially during the initial movement.\n*   Continue to commit fully to your follow-through.\n*   Practice your strokes against a variety of balls.\n\n\ud83d\udeab **Don\u2019ts**\n\n*   Rush your footwork; focus on precise movements.\n*   Let your elbow position become inconsistent during the swing.\n*   Overthink your technique; trust your instincts.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Recommended Drills**\n\n1.  **Shadow Batting with Focus on Footwork:** Spend 10-15 minutes each session shadow batting in front of a mirror. Concentrate *solely* on your footwork, ensuring you're getting into the correct positions for different shots (cover drive, pull shot, etc.). The goal is to internalize the correct movements.\n2.  **Cone Drills for Footwork:** Set up cones to simulate different ball lines (wide, straight, on the pads). Practice moving your feet to the correct cone before executing a shadow shot. This will improve your agility and foot placement.\n3.  **Mirror Practice for Swing Control:** Use a mirror to monitor your elbow position during your swing. Focus on maintaining a consistent elbow angle throughout the stroke. Start slow and gradually increase your speed as you gain control.\n4.  **Balance Ball Drills:** Stand on a balance ball or wobble board while shadow batting. This will enhance your core stability and improve your balance during your shots.\n5.  **Targeted Practice:** Ask someone to bowl you a variety of balls, focusing on the areas where your footwork and swing control are weakest. For example, practice your cover drive against slower, wider balls to improve your foot movement to the ball.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Final Motivation**\n\nYou've got a solid foundation to build on. By focusing on your footwork and swing control through consistent practice and targeted drills, you'll see significant improvements in your batting. Keep up the hard work, stay positive, and trust the process! You've got this!"
